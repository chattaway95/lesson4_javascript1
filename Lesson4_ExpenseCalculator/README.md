### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (In Javascript, you can define variables, and it is best to do so with descriptive and specific, but not overly wordy, ways. Variables can contain many different kinds of variables, and can include strings, booleans, arrays, numbers, etc.)
2. (Operators can be used both to perform mathmatic operations to the defined variables, as well as to concatenate/add together strings.)
3. (Javascript allows you to create popup windows, and the different kinds include alert boxes, confirmation boxes, and prompt boxes.)
